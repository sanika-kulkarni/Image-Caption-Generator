# Image-Caption-Generator
This project is an Image Caption Generator that combines Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to generate meaningful captions for images.  It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (VGG16) to extract features from an image and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)(LSTM) to generate captions.
